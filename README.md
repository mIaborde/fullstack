## How to test the stack

### Dev environment

```bash
# install dependencies
npm i
# run Postgres Database in container
npm run db
# run Nest Application Programming Interface
npm run api
# run Angular Progressive Web App
npm run pwa
```

### Prod environment

```bash
# install dependencies
npm i
# build all apps in prod mode
npm run release
# run all apps in containers
npm run containers
```

## How to make this monorepo yours

```bash
# clone this project and rename it
git clone https://github.com/mIaborde/fullstack your-project-name
# reset git history
rm -rf .git && git init
```

- Change `PUBLIC_ALL_APP_NAME` variable in **.env** file, `"name"` in **package.json**, and `npmScope` **nx.json**
- adapt **.env** to your needs and you are good to go
